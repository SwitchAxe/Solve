# Solve
A mathematical library and a modern (as in modern Cpp) clone of
mathematica with no ambitions.

# What's currently implemented
- [x] A working lexer for basic function calls, parameters, and brackets. Currently real numbers and integers are supported.
- [ ] A working parser for a token stream.
- [ ] Basic function composition for building arbitrarily complex
  polynomials (and more) from standard functions (`*`, `/`, `+`,
  `-` to name just a few important ones).
- [ ] Simple calculus operators like derivatives, limits, integrals and
  so on.
